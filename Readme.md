# Multibody Simulation of Gyroscope
Conducted simulations to analyse the Gyroscopic couple's behaviour, confirming its sensitivity to spin angular velocity (ωs) and precession angular velocity (ωp). The project's visualisations provided valuable insights that shed light on the dynamic interplay between these parameters.
